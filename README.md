# City of Austin's Traffic Cameras

## What is this?

Yea, it's a personal project where I just followed my nose. 

Started as 

* a nextjs website to provide a better viewing experience for the COA cameras,
* into a method for using thin-plate spline techniques to warp an arbitrarily composed camera image to geographic coordinates (rubber-sheeting)
* learning how to do this on the gpu to make it fast
* doing it for live video
* object detection & tracking
* doing statistics with it
* making a machine learning model that was flawed but a huge learning experience

and then i bailed -- I'll stand this up again one day, it's pretty ok.
